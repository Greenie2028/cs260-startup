# Friend Finder

[My Notes](notes.md)

 - Users sign in with email and password, optionally providing a phone number.
 - The app is designed around college-aged young adults.
 - Upon sign up users select a number of hobbies or interests that can be edited latter.
 - Users can then find friends that share a number of hobbies with them and decide whether or not they would like to reach out to them.


For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdownk
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

To combat the rising epidemic of loneliness among the younger generation, Friend Finder acts as a dating app, except for friends! A user inputs hobbies they have and activities they enjoy, and Friend Finder will match them with people with similar interests. If the users decide they would like to meet, they can provide contact information into the app to reach out to each other. With this app, those that may have trouble finding friends will have a much easier time.

### Design

![Design image](FriendFinderSketch.jpg)
It will be designed in a way that makes it easy to see as much information as was provided by the user. Having the ability to view ratings and the interests of users creates a way to find who matches your interests while allowing the community to self-regulate in decreasing the rating of users that are unkind or have malintent.

### Key features

- Hobby/Interest Match Making
- Reach Out Button/Functionality
- Profile Photo
- Database saving user information
- Menu of matched friends and give ratings.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Build the framework of the website, making the basic scaffolding of the website.
- **CSS** - Format the website and make it look much nicer.
- **React** - Allow for users to interact with the website with buttons to either accept or decline recommended friends.
- **Service** - Pull from database to match users that share similar interests.
- **DB/Login** - Login using email and password, store authentication credentials and user data.
